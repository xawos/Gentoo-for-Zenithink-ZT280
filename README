Soon i'll post an updated image.
My tablet is a Zenithink ZT280 C91 and it's actually emerging system and then world, but it will take a day or 2, depending on when i get home =)




To run Gentoo on you Zenithink ZT-280 tablet:

- put your SD(HC) memory card into a memory card reader connected to your PC,
- make a proper partition table:
 
 # cfdisk /dev/sdb
  Create 2 partitions.
  The first one only 16MB, the second one the rest of the SD.
  If you wish to add swap add it now or create later a swap file, but remember that it will probably choke SD's performance

- prepare filesystems on the partitions:

  # mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1
  # mke2fs -j -T small /dev/sdb2

- mount the first partition, make zt-update directory and copy the kernel image:

  # mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /mnt
  # mkdir /mnt/zt-debug
  # cp ZT280.kernel /mnt/zt-debug/
  # umount /mnt

  (kernel image filename is important!)

- mount the second partition and unpack stage3 tarball on it:

  # mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb2 /mnt
  # tar xvjpf stage3-ZT280.tar.bz2 -C /mnt
  (...)
  # umount /mnt
 
Place the memory card in your tablet's slot, press the power button and, when "ZTPAD" logo appears, immediately press CAMERA key. 

The system can be accessed remotely - just connect an Ethernet cable from your network to the RJ45 socket. SSHD is running by default and IP is configured via DHCP.

Login using username 'root' and password 'root'.
