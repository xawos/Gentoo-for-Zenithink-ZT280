Soon i'll post an updated image.
My tablet is a Zenithink ZT280 C91 H31a
The image i will post is taken from a 4GB uSD card and will have installed Awesome as DM plus Apache and Webmin.
The stage3 that you can find here is pretty old, i keep it as a tribute to Lukas (mtbg), the guy that made it in first place.




To run Gentoo on your Zenithink ZT-280 tablet:

- put your SD(HC) memory card into a memory card reader connected to your PC,
- make a proper partition table:
 
 # cfdisk /dev/sdb
  Create 2 partitions.
  The first one only 16MB, the second one the rest of the SD.
  If you wish to add swap add it now or create later a swap file, but remember that it will probably choke SD's performance

- prepare filesystems on the partitions:

  # mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1
  # mke2fs -j -T small /dev/sdb2

- mount the first partition, make zt-update directory and copy the kernel image:

  # mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /mnt
  # mkdir /mnt/zt-update
  # cp ZT280.kernel /mnt/zt-update/
  # umount /mnt

  (kernel image filename is important!)

- mount the second partition and unpack stage3 tarball on it:

  # mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb2 /mnt
  # tar xvjpf stage3-ZT280.tar.bz2 -C /mnt
  (...)
  # umount /mnt
 
Place the memory card in your tablet's slot, press the power button and, when "ZTPAD" logo appears, immediately press CAMERA key. 

The system can be accessed remotely - just connect an Ethernet cable from your network to the RJ45 socket.
SSHD is running by default and IP is configured via DHCP.
WEBMIN And APACHE are running at boot time, respectively on port 10000 and 80.
